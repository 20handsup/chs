Once again a coward, mad at--who knows what--loaded up his "killing machine" and went to the local bowling alley with the purpose killing as many innocent people as he could.  After killing twenty-two and wounding more than fifty he's disappeared.  The whole state is on the look-out for this coward.

It's being reported that the shooter/killer is known by authorities and known to have mental problems.  But nothing in that foreknowledge precipitated in an opportunity to stop this slaughter before it began.

## Other causes of rejection at the beginning of life

1. Being born the gender opposite of what the parents wanted

1. Being born with a deformity or physical disability

1. Constant criticism by parents, siblings, or authority figures

1. A sick or incapacitated brother or sister receiving prolonged medical care and attention

1. Fathers showing weakness, apathy, or passivity in their authority or responsibility roles

1. Subjection to sexual molestation or incest

1. A father becoming sexually aggressive to his wife in the presence of his children.

1. A spoiled or pampered child will end up feeling rejected
