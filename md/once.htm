      Once again a coward, mad at–who knows what–loaded up his “killing
      machine” and went to the local bowling alley with the purpose killing as
      many innocent people as he could. After killing twenty-two and wounding
      more than fifty he’s disappeared. The whole state is on the look-out for
      this coward.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s being reported that the shooter/killer is known by authorities and
      known to have mental problems. But nothing in that foreknowledge
      precipitated in an opportunity to stop this slaughter before it began.
